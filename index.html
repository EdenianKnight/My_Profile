    <h3>Favorites</h3>
    <p>
        My favorite colour is green. It reminds me of how beautiful nature is, especially because it is also the colour of tree leaves.<br>
        My favorite game is chess. I love the strategy and the mental challenge it provides. I also love Legend of Zelda—it is my favorite video game.
